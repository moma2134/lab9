# Lab9

This project contains automation code files that:
  - Automates the creation of Virtual Networks in OpenStack and connects to public network
  - Automates the creation of VM's in OpenStack (accessible from Host server and access present to the internet
  - Automating port and security groups creation
  - Automating the spinning up of FRR as a docker container

The screenshots show the output from the python modules that were executed.

- Python code output for VN, VM, & port security group creation
